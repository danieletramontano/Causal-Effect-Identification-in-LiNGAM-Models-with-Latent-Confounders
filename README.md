<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this section you should describe your project, including any datasets you used and appropriate citations. You may refer to your project report or cite your paper for more detailed information.

[Here goes the title with hyperlink](https://github.com/catiaspsilva/README-template)

You can include tables or images to summarize your results when and if appropriate.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In this section you should provide instructions on how to use this repository to recreate your project locally.

### Dependencies

Here, list all libraries, packages and other dependencies that need to be installed to run your project. Include library versions and how they should be installed if a special requirement is needed.

For example, this is how you would list them:
* Transformers 4.8.0
  ```sh
  conda install -c conda-forge transformers
  ```
* OpenCV 4.5.2
  ```sh
  conda install -c conda-forge opencv
  ```
### Alternative: Export your Environment

Alternatively, you can export your Python working environment, push it to your project's repository and allow users to clone it locally. This way, anyone can install it and they will have all dependencies needed. Here is how you export a copy of your Python environment:

  ```sh
  conda env export > requirements.yml
  ```

The user will be able to recreate it using:

  ```sh
  conda env create -f requirements.yml
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/catiaspsilva/README-template.git
   ```
2. Setup (and activate) your environment
  ```sh
  conda env create -f requirements.yml
  ```
